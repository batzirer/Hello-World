        <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
1.Preheat oven to 425°. Using a sharp paring <br> knife, cut a deep slit into each chicken <br>breast. Stuff pockets with mozzarella then press edges <br>of the chicken together to seal<br> the chicken. Season outside of chicken with salt and pepper. <br>
2.Put the flour, eggs and panko bread crumbs <br>into three separate shallow bowls. Into the <br>panko bread crumbs, whisk in garlic powder, dried oregano,<br> ¼ cup Parmesan and ½ teaspoon salt.<br>
3.Dip the stuffed chicken in flour, shaking <br>off excess, then dip the chicken into egg,<br> tossing to coat. Dredge chicken in bread crumbs, making sure<br> the chicken is evenly coated.<br>
4.In a large skillet over medium heat, heat a <br>thin layer of olive oil. Add chicken to <br>skillet and cook until golden on both sides, about 4 minutes<br> per side. Pour marinara around chicken <br>and scatter basil on top of marinara. Turn off heat<br> then sprinkle remaining Parmesan on top of chicken.<br>
5.Transfer skillet to oven and bake until the<br> chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes <br>more. Garnish with parsley and serve warm.<br>
